    <h1>Style h1 is black</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The paragraph style is a 14 point dark blue font. 
    <hr>
    <h2>Style h2 is red</h2>  
    <h3>Style h3 is blue</h3>
    <p>Different classes can be used within a style to give extra enhancement to the text. Text can be turned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>red</li>
        <li>yellow</li>
        <li>green</li>
        <li>or left unchanged</li>
      </ul> 
    <p>In fact any other colour could be used to enhance previously defined text. Other enhancements could be added like having classes to make parts of the work enhanced and coloured like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>blue and italic</li>
        <li>black and bold</li>
        <li>or left unchanged</li>
      </ul> 
    <p>Other features found earlier in the chapter can be added in a similar way.</p>
